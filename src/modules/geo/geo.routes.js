/**
 * Geocoding for the map picker (V3 §5, §6, §26).
 *
 * The clients never talk to Nominatim directly. Three reasons, in order of how
 * much they matter:
 *
 *   1. Its usage policy is a per-application budget with an identifying
 *      User-Agent, which a browser cannot honestly send and a phone app would
 *      multiply by its install count.
 *   2. `services/geocoding.js` already serialises every outbound call at one a
 *      second; routing merchant searches through the same queue is what keeps
 *      the whole application inside that budget.
 *   3. Web and mobile then geocode identically, which §23 requires of the
 *      location model and is just as true of how coordinates are found.
 *
 * Nothing here writes. The merchant's chosen pin only becomes real when they
 * save the shop or branch.
