 * `NOW()` and `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` follow the *session* time zone - `SYSTEM` by
 * default, i.e. whatever the database host is set to. On a host that is not UTC
 * the two halves disagree, and the damage is not limited to display:
 *
 *   - Columns written server-side (`claimed_at = NOW()`, the 88
 *     `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` defaults) land in local time, are read back as UTC,
 *     and show up shifted by the host's offset.
 *   - Worse, the comparisons shift too. `start_date <= NOW()` compares a UTC
 *     column against a local clock, so a scheduled offer goes live - and an
 *     active one expires - by that same offset early.
 *
 * Setting it per connection rather than globally keeps the fix with the code
 * that depends on it, and works on a managed database we do not administer.
