/**
 * Resolves everything the authorization layer needs about a user:
 *
 *   - roles assigned directly (users -> user_roles -> roles)
 *   - permissions those roles grant, split by the role's scope
 *   - shop memberships, each with the permissions that apply there
 *
 * Scope is what makes an Admin an admin *of a particular shop* (§3.2):
 *
 *   global role -> permissions apply everywhere
 *   shop role   -> permissions apply only to the shops the user is a member of
 *
 * So assigning ADMIN to someone grants nothing until they are also attached to
 * a shop, and it never leaks rights over shops they have no connection to.
 *
 * Permissions are resolved per request rather than embedded in the JWT so that
 * a revoked role or a new shop assignment takes effect immediately.
