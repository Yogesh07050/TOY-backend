 * VisibilityAnalyticsService (§30): "Records and aggregates visibility events."

 *   write - append one row per visibility event (§32). Best-effort, on the hot
 *           path of every discovery response, and never allowed to fail a
 *           customer request.
 *   read  - the merchant dashboard (§15), Premium analytics (§16) and campaign
 *           performance (§17).
 *
 * ## Why organic and featured share one table
 *
 * §20 requires that "Featured placement must not artificially change or falsify
 * organic analytics". The cheapest way to guarantee that is to make the split a
 * column rather than a convention: `placement_type` is NULL for organic and set
 * for promoted, so every organic figure is `placement_type IS NULL` and no
 * amount of promotional spend can leak into it. Two separate tables would have
 * made the same promise, and would have needed a UNION - and a UNION that
 * someone eventually writes without the filter.
