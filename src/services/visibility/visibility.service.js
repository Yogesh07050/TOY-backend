 * VisibilityService (§30).
 *
 * The orchestrator §14's flow describes:
 *
 *     customer location -> nearby listings -> filter active -> distance
 *       -> relevance -> subscription priority -> fairness & rotation -> results
 *
 * `ranking.service` does the scoring, `fairness` does the reordering,
 * `featuredPlacement.service` does the promotional rail. This module is what
 * puts them in the right order and hands back one answer - so a new surface is
 * a set of parameters rather than a fifth reimplementation of the same
 * sequence, and so nobody has to remember that frequency comes before rotation.
 *
 * ## Featured and organic are assembled separately, always
 *
 * §20: "Featured placement must not artificially change or falsify organic
 * analytics." Featured items are resolved from the slot, organic from the
 * scorer, and the two are concatenated rather than interleaved and scored
 * together. A promoted listing therefore cannot inflate its own organic
 * position, and its impressions are written with a `placement_type` that keeps
 * them out of every organic figure.
