/**
 * Guest/authenticated cache separation (V3 Guest Browsing §26).
 *
 * Public discovery is the same for every visitor, so it can be cached hard by
 * the browser and by any shared cache in front of the API. Anything derived
 * from the caller's account must never be stored anywhere it could be replayed
 * to a different customer.
 *
 * Two rules do the work:
 *
 *   1. `Vary: Authorization` on every API response. The personalised fields on
 *      an otherwise public payload (`isFavorite`, `isFollowing`, `isSaved`)
 *      come from the bearer token, so a cache keyed on the URL alone would hand
 *      one customer another customer's flags.
 *   2. A response is only marked `public` when the request arrived without a
 *      token AND the path is on the public-discovery list. Everything else -
 *      any authenticated request, any write, any user-scoped path - is
 *      `private, no-store`.
 *
 * The token check is on the raw header rather than `req.user`, because this
 * runs before the route's own `optionalAuth`.
